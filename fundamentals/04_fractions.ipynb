Fractions should be thought of as part of a whole. a fraction will always be a two part structure where we have the numerator and the denominator.

    "The aim is to reduce a fraction to its lowest terms. This is done by simplification and cancellation, for instance, assume we look at $\\frac {50}{100}$ we can see that this is a half, which is the same as $\\frac {5}{10}$. But we can further simplify. Indeed it's the same as $\\frac {2}{4}$ but that's still not the lowest terms. We can see that a half or 50% can be written as $\\frac {1}{2}$ and this is the lowest terms we can reach for our values.  \n",
